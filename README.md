# 🌐 Network+ Projects Portfolio
**A collection of hands-on networking projects demonstrating TCP/IP, client-server communication, and multithreading skills using Python and C++.**

---

## About This Portfolio
This repository showcases my **Network+ projects**, focusing on practical applications of **network protocols, socket programming, and network troubleshooting**. Each project highlights my ability to **design, implement, and debug network applications** in both Python and C++.

## Projects

| Project | Description | Key Technologies |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Python TCP Chat** | Multi-client chat application with nickname management and real-time messaging. Solved networking issues like `WinError 10049`. | Python, socket, threading, TCP/IP |
| **C++ File Transfer App** | Console-based client-server file transfer program with chunked transfer and error handling. | C++, TCP/IP, file I/O |
| **LAN Scanner** | Scans local network for active devices and open ports. Useful for network diagnostics and learning TCP/UDP fundamentals. | Python, socket, multithreading |
| **UDP Messaging App** | Lightweight UDP client-server messaging app demonstrating connectionless communication and packet handling. | Python, UDP, socket |
